Thank you for downloading this font!

My fonts are free for personal use. If you want to use one of my fonts for your commercial project, you can buy the commercial license by sending me $15/10€ through Paypal to this address: 28fonts@gmail.com

You can also use the "Donate to author" button on Dafont, right under the "Download" button, if you want.

After this, you can send me an email with your name (or company name) and I'll send you the commercial license file. Don't hesitate to send me pictures of your work!

Regular donations are also highly appreciated! Thank you for supporting my work!
